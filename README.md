Biblio and research supporting [nucon](www.nucon.io), will be updated regularly.

## Researchers to follow

- [Peter ED Love](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=7Eszm_8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works), researches heavily into organizational learning and the role of information system to prevent rework in construction.
- [Per-Erik Josephson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dSsdb0QAAAAJ&hl=en), pioneer in defects research with primary data. Dated but still relevant.

## Concepts

- Double Loop learning, a central idea in process improvement in organizations. [Double Loop Learning in Organizations](https://hbr.org/1977/09/double-loop-learning-in-organizations).
- Causes of defects and their costs. [Defects and Defects Costs in Construction](http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/201455/local_201455.pdf). Josephson, 1998.
- Rework gives 43% variance in cost performance. [Make-or-Break During Production: Shedding Light on Change-Orders, Rework and Contractors Margin in Construction](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Love2/publication/328138314_Make-or-Break_During_Production_Shedding_Light_on_Change-Orders_Rework_and_Contractors_Margin_in_Construction/links/5bbc09e7299bf1049b75e10b/Make-or-Break-During-Production-Shedding-Light-on-Change-Orders-Rework-and-Contractors-Margin-in-Construction.pdf). Love, 2018.
- The importance of organizational learning in construction. [Total quality management and the learning organization: a dialogue for change in construction](sci-hub.tw/10.1080/014461900370681). Love, 2010.
- Human factors mitigating the prevention of errors. [The Praxis of Stupidity: An Explanation to Understand the Barriers to Rework Mitigation](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Love2/publication/327160130_The_Praxis_of_Stupidity_An_Explanation_to_Understand_the_Barriers_Mitigating_Rework_in_Construction/links/5b7d5e56a6fdcc5f8b5bbf03/The-Praxis-of-Stupidity-An-Explanation-to-Understand-the-Barriers-Mitigating-Rework-in-Construction.pdf). Love, 2018.

## Industry validation

- Knowledge preservation as top priority. [Older workers: Why construction cannot afford to lose them](https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/analysis/expert-opinion/older-workers-why-construction-cannot-afford-to-lose-them/10036900.article?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)
- World Economic Forum: knowledge transfer needs to happen from project to project (CMD+F "lessons learned"). [Shaping the Future of Construction A Breakthrough in Mindset and Technology](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Shaping_the_Future_of_Construction_full_report__.pdf)

> The execution of construction projects all too often relies heavily on the expertise or even intuition of the individual project manager. Even though no two construction projects are identical, the “lessons learned” from any one project can prove very helpful when applied to another. Ideally, companies should institutionalize these lessons, so that project management can undergo continuous improvement across projects.

## Technical readings

- Modeling rework with probability distribution. [A rework probability model: a quantitative assessment of rework occurrence in construction projects](https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15623599.2015.1033814)
